# SQL-Interview-Question
A question I was asked to test my SQL knowledge when interviewing for a data position at a finance company.

The question is:  
You have the following information... three people work for you, you have goals that they need to reach at the end of each month, one of your workers doesn't start until a later date. Create a SQL statement that shows your workers' goals for each month taking into account their start date.  

I have included csv tables for the given data, an ERD and schema to show my thought process when I was planning out the solution (drawing these helps me work it out), and finally the sql statement that gives me the solution.
